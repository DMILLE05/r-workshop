# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R using the ggplot2 package from the tidyverse.

we will install these packages
-tidyverse: is a suite of packages for wrangling and viz (ggplot)
-readxl: to read excel files (in many ways)
-here: to help with filepaths
```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readxl) # install
library(here) # install

```
#Cal National Parks data
```{r}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data/ca_np.csv"))
# also be written
ca_np <- read_csv("data/ca_np.csv")

```
